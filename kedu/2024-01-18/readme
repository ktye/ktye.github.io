especially when we(you) write the +\ version.
this is exactly what we need for
{}()[] parsing
e.g.
~+\(')'==z)-('('==z)

backwards because c==z gives -1 and 0

please write the arm/avx2/avx512 for +\G (also IJEF)
maybe avx2 can use the avx512 code?


what should we call these? we have

SPM (sum prd max)  (in k/pro we call these APM)
ghij(ints) cdef(floats)(8 16 32 64)
 S_ _s  s   S  _S
a+x 0-x +/x +\x -'x
a*x 1%x */x *\x %'x
a|x   ? |/x |\x   ?
Register and vector so roughly 720 functions [+*|][Tt][+-/\'][ghijcdef][arm/avx5/avx6]

please write [sS][GIJEF] (register scans and reduces)
