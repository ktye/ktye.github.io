b_ is bit from byte(_b byte from bit)
b2 is bit from int(i.e.size2)
X9 is ~\
i0&i2 are indexing(byte int)

a0 is at-size-0. i.e. indexing into byte array.
x86(and arm?) can do 32 or 64 at a time.
easy to write loop, e.g.

i(32,rc=sa[xc])

i use it for parse-unparse (since there are about 32 glyphs. 09 az are blended in.)

in a loop i think you might as well do all 70 values(32+10+26+..) . i.e. dont bother with blend.
with avx512(64bytes) we could almost do all the glyphs in one instruction.
for parse we shift alphanumeric into range. unparse is fine as is.

btw if there is a 32byte version(e.g. avx2) then 64byte is 3 or 4 instructions. maybe in parallel
