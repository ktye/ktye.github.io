im putting in '/\ so we can parse from k.
e.g. functions for
string number alpha ( [ . (adverb verb or monads/pemdas/bodmas/..)

:'~\"'"=
&'"0"=c@
&'"a"=c@
:'+\1 -1"()"?
:'+\1 -1"[]"?
"'"=c@   adverb
>'"+"=c@  verb

pemdas

|'"+"=
|'"-"=
..

these are all vector functions and can be practically instantaneous(100GB per second).

(the ()[] +\ is a little slower)
the reductions are just apl-compress which is also 100GB per second
