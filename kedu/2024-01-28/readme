now c/b are almost identical. b just has vector ops.(10 times faster than c)
c is very useful for me and antonio. we can check things much more easily.
btw there are about 80 primitives in b/c. ('a' has several more)
but still several NYI


20 monads
20 dyads
12+18 derived [x][fF]'/\ [cCiIeE]'/\
N inverse pairs  "lxyz.."@?


there are 7 Order funcs
^<> ?= (#=) (#'=)
these will all fit in one line of c
