<h1>kde</h1>
<i>i never use an ide, except those i write myself</i>
<p>
<a href="index.html">kde</a> includes:
<ul>
 <li>editor with k syntax mode</li>
 <li>k repl</li>
 <li>file browser</li>
 <li>buttons</li>
</ul>
it is a web application that can access the local file system if you permit.</br>
it can be installed as a progressive web application to work offline, if you so wish.

<h2>editor</h2>
the editor is codemirror with bracket matching, block editing (alt-click-move-mouse), and k syntax mode that should catch errors early:
<ul>
 <li><code>"strings"</code> and </code>`symbols</code> are detected</li>
 <li>non-matching brackets <code>(}</code> are marked as errors</li>
 <li><code>({[;]})</code> are colored by 3 nesting levels</li>
 <li><code>$[cond;a;cond;b]</code> marks conditions differently</li>
 <li><code>$[c;a;c;b]</code> indicates an error for missing else</li>
 <li><code>1+ \x</code> highlights debug backslash</li>
 <li>source: <a href="k.mode.js">syntax parser</a>, <a href="k.mode.css">colors</a></li>
</ul>

try:
<textarea>
/this is k
func:{[x;y] \(x;y)  /trace
 "st\n\"({"         /string
 `"symbol"`a01`a`0n /symbols 
 1+$[x>0;x*x        /cond coloring
     x&lt;0;y;x+y]}    /adding another case shows error
     
/unmatched braces
)ORIGIN 1
</textarea>

clicking <code>run</code> restarts k and evaluates the program in the editor.</br>
the same can be done with <code>shift-enter</code> or <code>shift-rightclick</code> in the editor.
if some text is selected, these shortcuts only send the current selection to the repl, without restarting k.</p>

<b>multiple files</b> are executed, if the editor starts with <code>/!</code></br>
e.g. if the editor has the first line: <code>/!a.k b.k</code>, it executes <code>a.k</code> then <code>b.k</code> followed by the program in the editor.


<h2>repl</h2>
the repl is a <i>contenteditable</i> pre element.<br/>
pressing return deletes everything after the current location and executes the current line.<p>

k runs in a webworker in a separate thread as the ui.<br/>
if k does not return directly, e.g. <code>(1+)/:1</code> it can be interrupted with the <code>int</code> button, which is enabled when k is busy.
<code>int</code> terminates and restarts the webworker.
all data in k memory is reset, but the filesystem in the ui is still loaded.

<h2>browser</h2>

by default you can edit and execute the contents of the editor.<br/>
to load files from disk, you have to open a directory by button, or drop a directory in the window.
the filesystemapi is not supported by all browsers and you need to grant access.<br>
only one directory is supported, no subdirs.<p>

click on a file to open it in the editor. it can be saved back to disk.</br>
the browser highlights the open file(bold) and underlines it if modified,
but does not track changes on disk.<p>

k also has file system access within the directory that is loaded.<br/>
<code>`file&lt;"bytes"</code> writes to disk and
<code>x:&lt;`file</code> reads.<br/>
<code>`$&lt;`"."</code> returns a list of all file names as symbols.<br/>
to read a file, it must be preloaded (k.wasm cannot work with asynchronous js apis).<br/>
files are preloaded when clicking <code>load all</code> or when the file has been clicked on.
k-files are always preloaded.

<h1>todo</h1>

<h2>extended repl</h2>
<pre>
in the interactive repl, kst should truncate to the current size.
take a reference of each result.
store the k reference in js associated with the repl line number.
when hovering the line, let the gui:
- assign the value to x(global)
- serialize and store in x.bin
values leak in interactive use, but are reset when clicking run
(and maybe when deleting lines)
</pre>


<h2>error indicator</h2>
<pre>
when k detects an error with position, the position is an offset to the current source.
the current source is 
"\n"/:(z.k       /built-in k.wasm
       a.k;b.k   /by first line: /!a.k b.k
       ed)       /editor value
if the error is in the editor source, it is shown directly (highlight+jump)
if it is in a.k,b.k.. add a link to the repl to open the file+position in the repl
that leaves time to save the current file.
if it is in z.k, that could be shown in the repl as the readonly file "(z.k)"

more details are present in debug
</pre>

<h2>debug</h2>
<pre>
a checkbox uses d.wasm instead of k.wasm
d.wasm is a debug build that calls fpush and fpop (into js)
for each function call in kvm.
js then knows about the function arguments of the complete call stack
and the source positions

in the case of a error, a call stack is printed to the repl with links
to the source files+positions.
also the function arguments are present, type+length printed directly and
assignable to x, as described in the repl extensions above.
</pre>

<h2>static analysis</h2>
<pre>
when clicking run, a linter pass is first executed:
a new k is started that only parses all source.
it returns the k-list (kvm instructions) to js which can analyse, e.g.:
- parse error
- misspelled variable: referencing a variable that isn't assigned anywhere
- detecting use before assign for local variables
- ... what else can be done? 
if there are no errors, a new k is started that does the real work.
if there are errors, they are shown as links:
lint(parse):a.k:13:2
</pre>

<h2>find definition</h2>
<pre>
search the current editor all files referenced with a /!a.k b.k line
for the definition of the selected text.
that could be /^name:/
</pre>

<h2>grep</h2>
<pre>
search a word through all preloaded files.
show the results in the repl as links file:line
how? another button? type in the repl, mark and ...?
</pre>

<h2>ui layout</h2>
<pre>
the ui has 3 panels: editor, repl and browser.
when any of these overflows it shows scrollbars.
if the user single-clicks on a scrollbar that means:
try to make it go away. rearrange the panels by whatever that means.
</pre>

<h2>plot canvas</h2>
<pre>
simple plot.js
 plot F          plot `x`y!(!x;x)
 plot(F;F;..)    plot `x`y(!'x;x) multiple lines
 plot Z          polar
 plot(Z;Z;..)    polar multiple datasets
single canvas, autoscale, grid, click-to-point, zoom rectangle, no decoration
</pre>
