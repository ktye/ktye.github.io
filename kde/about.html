<h1>kde</h1>
<img src="icon.svg" style="height:1em" />
<i>i never used an ide, except those i wrote myself</i>
<p>
<a href="index.html">kde</a> includes:
<ul>
 <li>editor with k syntax mode</li>
 <li>repl</li>
 <li>file browser</li>
 <li>debugger</li>
</ul>
it is a web application that can access the local file system if you permit.<br>
it can be installed as a progressive web application to work offline, if you so wish.


<h2>editor</h2>
the editor is codemirror with bracket matching, block editing (alt-click-move-mouse), and k syntax mode that should catch errors early:
<ul>
 <li><code>/comments</code> and <code>"strings"</code> are detected</li>
 <li><code>semicolons</code> are printed lighter</li>
 <li><code>$[cond;a;cond;b;else]</code> marks conditions differently</li>
 <li><code>$[cond;a;cond;b]</code> indicates an error for missing else</li>
 <li><code>1+ \x</code> highlights debug backslash</li>
 <li>non-matching brackets <code>(}</code> are marked as errors</li>
 <li>source: <a href="k.mode.js">syntax parser</a>, <a href="k.mode.css">colors</a></li>
</ul>

try:
<textarea>
/this is k
func:{[x;y] \(x;y)  /trace
 "st\n\"({"         /string dont's mess bracket matching
 1+$[x>0;x*x        /cond coloring
     x&lt;0;y;x+y]}    /add another case to see the error
     
/unmatched braces
)ORIGIN 1
</textarea>

<p>clicking <code>run</code> restarts k and evaluates the program in the editor.<br>
the same can be done with <code>shift-enter</code> or <code>shift-rightclick</code> in the editor.
if some text is selected, these shortcuts only send the current selection to the repl, without restarting k.
clicking an a line number executes that line only.</p>

<b>multiple files</b> are executed, if the editor starts with <code>/!</code><br>
e.g. if the editor has the first line: <code>/!a.k b.k</code>, it executes <code>a.k</code> then <code>b.k</code> followed by the program in the editor.


<h2>repl</h2>
the repl shows k output and remains active after running the program in the editor.<br>
k output lines also keep a reference to the underlying k value.
hovering over an output line displays it in red and shows the type information.
double-clicking on it resends it to the input and right-clicking assigns it to <code>x</code>.<p>

k runs in a webworker in a separate thread as the ui.<br>
if k does not return directly (e.g. <code>(1+)/:1</code>), it can be interrupted with the <code>int</code> button, which is enabled when k is busy.
<code>int</code> terminates and restarts the webworker.
all data in k memory is reset, but the filesystem in the ui is still loaded.

<h2>file browser</h2>

by default you can edit and execute the contents of the editor.<br>
to load files from disk, you have to open a directory by clicking <code>open</code>, or drop a directory in the window.
the filesystemapi is not supported by all browsers and you need to grant access.<br>
only one directory is supported, no subdirs.<p>

click on a file to open it in the editor. <code>put</code> writes it back to disk.<br>
the browser highlights the open file <b><code>bold</code></b> and <u><code>underlines</code></u> modified files that have not been written.
it does not track changes happening on disk.<p>

k also has file system access within the directory that is loaded.<br>
<code>`file&lt;"bytes"</code> writes to disk and
<code>x:&lt;`file</code> reads.<br>
<code>`$&lt;`"."</code> returns a list of all file names as symbols.<br>
to read a file, it must be preloaded (k.wasm cannot work with asynchronous js apis).<br>
files are preloaded when clicking <code>rda</code> or when the file has been opened in the editor.
k-files are always preloaded.<p>

entering text in the the input field of the file browser searches for the input text in all loaded files
and prints links for all matches in the console (like grep but no regex).


<h2>error indicator</h2>
when k detects an error with position, the position is an offset to the current source, a catenation of the executed files:
<pre>
"\n"/:(z.k       /built-in k.wasm
       a.k;b.k   /by first line: /!a.k b.k
       ed)       /editor value
</pre>
if the error is within the code shown in the editor, it is highlighted directly.
otherwise a link is appended to the repl giving the user time to save the current file.<p>

only the innermost error position is tracked by kvm.
that may may be in the built-in <code>z.k</code> (e.g. the formatter), which may not be very informative.<br>
for a complete stack trace, use the debugger by clicking <code>trc</code>.

<h2>trace/debug</h2>
clicking <code>trc</code> instead of <code>run</code> uses <code>d.wasm</code> instead of <code>k.wasm</code>.
it is a special build of k that traces each call in the virtual machine by calling js functions <code>fpush</code> and <code>fpop</code>.
js stores all functions and their arguments on a stack that is present in case of a trap.<br>
the repl shows an interactive stack trace with source positions:
clicking on the file shows the source of the function call and double clicking on the k values prints the function or argument values in the repl.<br>
the first line also shows the type and position of the error where it has been triggered in the source of the k interpreter.

<h1>todo</h1>

<h2>static analysis</h2>
<pre>
when clicking run, a linter pass is first executed:
a new k is started that only parses all source.
it returns the k-list (kvm instructions) to js which can analyse, e.g.:
- parse error
- misspelled variable: referencing a variable that isn't assigned anywhere
- detecting use before assign for local variables
- ... what else can be done? 
if there are no errors, a new k is started that does the real work.
if there are errors, they are shown as links:
lint(parse):a.k:13:2
</pre>

<h2>find definition</h2>
<pre>
search the current editor all files referenced with a /!a.k b.k line
for the definition of the selected text.
that could be /^name:/
</pre>

<h2>grep</h2>
<pre>
search a word through all preloaded files.
show the results in the repl as links file:line
how? another button? type in the repl, mark and ...?
</pre>

<h2>ui layout</h2>
<pre>
the ui has 3 panels: editor, repl and browser.
when any of these overflows it shows scrollbars.
if the user single-clicks on a scrollbar that means:
try to make it go away. rearrange the panels by whatever that means.
</pre>

<h2>plot canvas</h2>
<pre>
simple plot.js
 plot F          plot `x`y!(!x;x)
 plot(F;F;..)    plot `x`y(!'x;x) multiple lines
 plot Z          polar
 plot(Z;Z;..)    polar multiple datasets
single canvas, autoscale, grid, click-to-point, zoom rectangle, no decoration
</pre>
