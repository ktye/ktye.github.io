        y _lsq A is least squares x for y~+/A*x (i.e. Ax=y)
 
Rand:   x _draw y (from !y); x _draw -y (deal from !y); x _draw 0 (from (0,1))
 
Time:   _t is gmt seconds. _lt is local from gmt, e.g. _gtime _lt _t
        _jd yyyymmdd (and _dj) for to and from julian day number (0 is monday)
 
List:   x _in y is 1 if x is an item of y; 0 otherwise (list: _lin)
