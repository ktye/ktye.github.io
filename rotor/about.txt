to calculate the response of a rotating shaft to unbalance forces, we start with the Euler-Bernoulli beam model, a 4th order partial
differential equation:
                                                          ∂²w      ∂⁴w
                                                       ρA ⎯⎯⎯ + EI ⎯⎯⎯ = 𝑓(z,t).
                                                          ∂t²      ∂z⁴

with appropriate rescaling we can get rid of physical parameters. the operator has the form ∂²/∂t² + ∂⁴/∂z⁴, which handles one
spatial direction only. the second term is a left-over from the biharmonic(laplace) operator ∆∆.
the nature of the equation is an oscillation equation, e.g. how initial conditions propagate over time and space and/or how the system
reacts to external excitation combined on the right hand side.
 
for now, we are only interested in the shape of the 1d structure as it rotates, and deforms (deflection/bending) due to the forces of
concentrated unbalances at discrete positions. we do not consider the general multi-frequency response, e.g. due to impacts.

as such the equation is misleading: it is not a vibration problem, but rather an equilibrium between the unbalance forces at a fixed
rotational speed and the restoring forces of the bent shaft due to it's elastic properties. there is no oscillation involved at all,
the shaft is simply bent (like a banana) and rotates around the axis defined by the bearings.
however the equation has the same form and we can replace ∂²/∂t² with -Ω². Ω is the rotational speed (angle by time).

- analytic solutions -

consider a uniform shaft with two springs as support on both sides. critical speeds ω are computed from the eigenvalues λ=ω² of
the homogenous system.  they increase with the stiffness c of the springs from unsupported c=0 to rigid support c=∞.

0     0      1π        mode 0 and 1 are rigid body modes (translation and rotation) for the free b.c.
1     0      2π        for fixed, mode 0 has the shape of half a sine wave, 1 of a full wave and so on.
2     1.5π   3π        the increasing harmonics 1 2 3.. times π are factors to √ω, not to the frequency ω as for a guitar string,
3     2.5π   4π        which is 2nd order ∂²/∂t²-∂²/∂z² instead of 4th. that's why hitting a beam does not sound as good.

- finite elements -

 • from 8x8 real element matrices
 • assemble shaft matrices K M G
 • add node properties: discrete discs, masses, springs(inplace of boundary conditions)
 • combine to large complex system matrix for one speed        ⮢
 • solve linear system, e.g. with LU decomposition, for each speed

to calculate the solution for general shaft geometries, we use finite elements to discretize the rotor and end up with some matrices:
(single-element-matrices for an isotropic system)
                      stiffness matrix K                   mass matrix M                        state vector q

these are the matrices for one element only. w and φ are displacement and angle of the elements at both of their ends.
multiple elements are assembled together and form a larger matrix:

                                  ██████████████━━━━━━━━━━   ⋯    (2-element-example, 3 nodes)
                                  z₀           z₁        z₂
each element has different parameters for ρAEIL. as you can see, the right coordinate (z₁) of one element is the left for the next one.
for a single element we have two end nodes, 4x4 shaft matrices and a length-4 state vector.
for a three element model, we have 4 nodes, a state vector of length 16 and 16x16 shaft matrices.
the matrices overlap by two rows and columns, the elements are simply added:

  ┌───────┐      (assembly process)
  │       │
  │   ┌───┼───┐
  │   │ + │   │
  └───┼───┼───┼─
      │   │ + │
      └───┼───┘⋱

the final equation to solve is   -MΩ² q + K q = rhs   which is a linear system of equations for each speed Ω.
it reveals the shape of the rotor by it's displacements w₀,w₁,.. (every other element of q) at the nodal positions z₀,z₁,..


- xy-asymmetry -

so far we only consider one spacial dimension x besides the axial coordinate z. this is ok as long as the model is symmetric
for x and y, e.g. only contains shaft elements with circular cross sections and isotropic bearings (same stiffness in both directions).
however we want to demonstrate at least the influence of anisotropic bearings which are very common, e.g. the stiffness in vertical
direction towards the ground is very often different from the stiffness in horizontal direction.

another reason to extend the model is to study the influence of gyroscopic forces to the system.
gyroscopic forces are effective only for (relatively) high speeds and large cross section areas, such as concentrated discs, flywheels,
turbine blades, etc.  the key feature is that if the shaft line has a slope φ in the x-z plane, because it is bent and rotates, it
introduces forces (moments to be more specific) in the plane perpendicular to it: y-z, which have the tendency to bend it as well.
gyroscopic forces couple the two directions.

unfortunately this means we have to double the system order, get 4 times as many matrix elements and need to compute 8 times as much
to solve the system:

to assemble the system matrices from the element matrices we do:

matrices are represented as vectors in ravel order, instead of using 2d indexing which should also be possible.


- rigid elements, elastic bearings -

once the system matrices KMG are assembled, they can be modified to account for further details:
elastic support (e.g. a spring) at the location of a node adds it's stiffness directly to a single element of matrix K

k) diag:(!k)+k*!k
   K[diag]+:,/+(cx;cy;0;0)                        /add spring support to digonal
   M[diag]+:,/+(m;m;Q;Q)                          /add mass and equatorial moment of inertia of disc elements to diagonal
   G[1+i+k*i:2+4*!n]-:J                           /add polar moments of inertia to gyroscopic matrix counter diagonal
   G[i+k*1+i:2+4*!n]+:J
   B:-0.02*K                                      /damping proportional to K*ω

the stiffness input vectors cx and cy are mostly 0 except for the location of discrete springs.
more complicated bearing models are not considered, but many exist: spring-mass-damper systems, hydrodynamic bearings, rollers, ...
classic boundary conditions are achieved by restricting a node to allow only rotation but no displacement or forcing the slope to be
zero. this needs more consideration and removes some rows and columns from the system matrix.

discrete mass or disc elements are placed at node locations. these elements cannot deform but contribute to the mass and gyroscopic
properties in the case of discs.  m is the vector of mass elements, and J and Q are vectors of moments of inertia for each node,
J around the axis of rotation and Q around the axes perpendicular to it (rotational symmetric cross sections only, e.g. cylindric).

all three KMG matrices are real valued, but the system is not.
the right hand side U is a vector of unbalances with one value per node. it is complex and the phase indicates the angle around the
shaft axis of the location of a discrete unbalance mass attached at distance r from the shaft. only mass times radius is important,
hence U has dimension mass times length.

k) u:,/1 1a90 0 0*/U                              /unbalance excitation vector

u spreads the excitation around two degrees of freedom, taking the rotation of the shaft into account: the excitation in x and y
direction is 90 degree apart, and it has no direct contribution to the moment (slope coordinates are 2 3 6 7..).


- solving the system matrix -
the system equation combines all matrices to form a complex valued matrix A which unfortunately is dependend on speed Ω.
the right hand side depends only on the unbalance excitations:

k) f:{[w]solve[k^imag[K-w2*M;B+w2*G];w2:w*w*u][,/0 1+/4*!n]}
               ╰───── matrix───────╯ ╰─ rhs ─╯ displacements

this means for a given model, we assembly the real valued shaft model matrices KMG, combined them for each speed value to a large
complex system matrix and solve it for each set of unbalances applied to the shaft.
from the result vector we can take the nodes that we are interested and use the displacements only.
the displacements in x and y direction are complex valued and can be combined with sin and cos Ωt to retrieve real valued displacments,
periodic with each revolution.

solving the quadratic system A x = b can be done with LU decomposition and partial pivoting:

k) lu:{[A]i:0;k:!#A;P:!#A;while[
    1<#k;j:i+*&a=m:|/a:abs A[k;i]
    P[(i;j)]:P[(j;i)];A[(i;j)]:A[(j;i)];A[k:1_k;i]%:A[i;i];A[k;k]-:A[k;i]*\A[i;k];i+:1]
    (A;P)}
   lusolve:{[LUP;b];A:*LUP;P:*|LUP
    r:{[x;i;a]x[i]-:+/(a k)*x k:!i}/[b P;!n:#A;A]
    {[x;i;a]x[i]:(x[i]-+/(a k)*x k:(1+i)_!#x)%a[i]}/[r;|!n;|A]}
   solve:{lusolve[lu x;y]}

it turn's out it's too slow for this version of k for an interactive ui. the lu decomposition is rewritten in wasm which is 20x faster.
