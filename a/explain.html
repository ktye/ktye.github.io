<span class="s">#include"a.h"//fF[+-!#,@] atom/vector 1byteint 1bytetoken  no(memmanage parser tokens ..)<span class="e">
+-!#,@ are are the list of primitives that are implemented in simple/k
fF means for both monadic and dyadic cases
the implementation contains atoms and vectors
but only for one data size: all values are one integers, e.g. -128..127
tokens are limited to single digit numbers as well
a true implementation needs memory management (allocate/free/reuse..)
this is not included here. vectors are allocated but never freed.
k/simple includes a parser and tokenizer in a basic form.
</span></span>
<span class="s">#define r(n,e) _(u r=a(n);i(n,ri=e)r)<span class="e" id="r">
r is defined as a macro.
it returns a vector of length n and assigns the expression e to each element.
<span class="l">a</span> creates the result array and <span class="l">ri</span>=e assigned the e to the element r[i]</span></span>
<span class="s">f(w,write(1,ax?(u)&x:x,ax?1:strlen(x)))<span class="e">
f(w,..) defines the monadic function w(x).
w uses the unix system call (see "man 2 write") and writes to stdout.
strlen is a libc function that clang recognizes as a builtin.
it returns the length of the string by counting until a 0 byte occurs in the data.
strings in c are terminated by the sential value 0. they do not contain a length.
but this is just a convention. we later define arrays, storing length and data.

w uses <span class="l">ax</span> to check if the argument is an atom.
for atoms it calls write passing a pointer to the argument &x and the length 1.
for vectors it passes x which in this case is interpreted as a pointer as it is.</span></span>
<span class="s">c b[12];<span class="e">
b is an array of type c with length 12. c definitions are type name.
the length comes last and is not part of the type.
b is only used locally as a buffer by the next function
but is defined as a global variable.</span></span>
<span class="s">f(si,sprintf(b,"%d ",128>x?x:x-256);b)<span class="e">
si(x) prints/formats the number x into the buffer b including a space
used for printing vectors (or atoms where we don't see it).
the argument x is an unsigned integer but is used to format signed integers.
the max value for the domain is 127 and we get negative number with x-256.
si returns the buffer because the next function calls it as w(si(x)) and w expects
the buffer as an argument.
</span></span>
<span class="s">f(wi,w(si(x)))<span class="e">
wi writes an integer, by calling w(si(x))</span></span>
<span class="s">f(w_,$(ax,wi(x))i(nx,wi(xi))w(10))<span class="e" id="w_">
w_ writes a k value (atom or vector).
ax tests if x is an atom calling wi directly, otherwise it calls
wi in a loop for each element <span class="l">xi</span>.
the conditonal form $(a,b)c is defined as a macro <span class="l">$</span>
it is very similar to the ternary operator that c already has: a?b:c
the difference is that in a ternary operator a b and c must be expressions.
the operator itself is also an expression, it has a value.
but the loop <span class="l">i</span>(nx,..) is a block and cannot be used
in a ternary expression.</span></span>

<span class="s">F(err,w(f);w(58);w(x);w(10);96)<span class="e">
err(f,x) writes an error message. it is called by <span class="l">Qr</span> <span class="l">Qz</span>.
the arguments are the current function and the error string "rank" or "nyi".
the error message has the form (function):(error-type)(newline)</span></span>
<span class="s">G(m,(u)memcpy((void*)x,(void*)y,f))<span class="e" id="m">
m(f,x,y) moves/copies data by calling the builtin memcopy.
it reorders the argument: the first arg is the number of elements to copy,
followed by destination and source pointer.</span></span>
<span class="s" id="a">f(a,c*s=malloc(x+1);*s++=x;(u)s)<span class="e">
a(x) creates a vector. it allocates memory using the builtin malloc,
which expects a length (number of bytes).
it passes 1 element more than needed, stores the array length in the first
element and increases the pointer to the result c before returning it.
in this form c points to the data part of the vector and c[-1] is the length
usually accessed by <span class="l">nx</span></span></span>
<span class="s">f(foo,Qz(1)0)<span class="e">
foo is a function that print the nyi error.
it is a placeholder within the function <span class="l">table</span> for monadic primitives.</span></span>
<span class="s">f(sub,ax?(c)-x:r(nx,-xi))<span class="e">
sub is arithmetic negate, a monadic function.
it negates atoms and uses <span class="l">r</span> to negate all elements of a vector.
in (c)-x, (c) is a type cast. this casts the type from a longer integer to char.
both are unsigned, but the effect is that all but the lower byte remain 0 instead
of 1 because of sign extension.</span></span>
<span class="s">f(ind,Qr(!ax)r(x,i))<span class="e">
ind is !x known as til x, iota, or index generation.
it uses <span class="l">Qr</span> to check the rank of x and allows only atoms.
<span class="l">r</span> creates a return array and assigns the loop variable i to each element.</span></span>
<span class="s">f(cnt,Qr(ax)nx)<span class="e" id="cnt">
cnt is #x, also known as ‚ç¥ or tally. is fails for atoms and returns the length of vectors using <span class="l">nx</span></span></span>
<span class="s">f(cat,Qr(!ax)r(1,x))<span class="e">
cat is ,x the monadic form known as enlist.
it allows only atoms, creates a length-1 vector putting x inside.</span></span>
<span class="s">F(Add,ax?af?f+x:Add(x,f):r(nx,(af?f:fi)+xi))<span class="e" id="Add">
Add is the example for a scalar function that extends atoms to vectors for
all 4 combinations of atom/vector arguments.
it uses a nested ternary test for the arguments.
note that f is the first arg and x the second.
if x is an atom but f is a vector is switches the arguments and calls itself again.
the final expression r(nx,..) handles the part where x is a vector and iterates
over x. f is checked within the loop each time and either added directly or indexed
with the loop variable.</span></span>
<span class="s">F(Sub,Add(f,sub(x)))<span class="e">
Sub is like Add but instead of implementing it again it negates the second argument
and calls Add.</span></span>
<span class="s">F(Ind,Qr(!f)r(nx,xi%f))<span class="e">
Ind is f!x and takes the modulo.
f is checked to be nonzero. it can only be an atom,
since we have neither vector literals nor parens.
the right argument x is not checked and assumed to be a vector.
x is rank checked to be a vector (try 3!4 and see it crash).</span></span>
<span class="s">F(Cnt,Qr(!af)r(f,ax?x:xi))<span class="e">
Cnt is take: f#x.
f is alywas atomic, x may be both.
the return array is filled in a loop using <span class="l">r</span>.</span></span>
<span class="s">F(Cat,f=af?cat(f):f;x=ax?cat(x):x;u r=a(nf+nx);m(nx,r+nf,x);m(nf,r,f))<span class="e">
Cat is catenation: f,x.
it rank checks both arguments and enlists each if it's an atom.
Cat returns a vector explicitly with u r=a(..) giving it the catenated length 
of both arguments.</span></span>
<span class="s">F(At,Qr(af)ax?sf[x]:r(nx,sf[xi]))f(at,At(x,0))<span class="e" id="At">
At(f,x) is indexing. f must be a vector but x can be both atom or vector.
it uses sf[x] or sf[xi] to index into the array f.

watch carefully, the line also defines the monadic funcion at(x).
this is what we know as first, maybe as the value "at the location of x"
or the "head of the list". it indexes with a 0 value.</span></span>
<span class="s">char*V=" +-!#,@";<span class="e">
V defines a character vector that is used by the parser.
we also see which primitives are included in the demo implementation.</span></span>
<span class="s">u(*f[])()={0,foo,sub,ind,cnt,cat,at},(*F[])()={0,Add,Sub,Ind,Cnt,Cat,At},U[26];<span class="e" id="table">
this line defines two arrays of function pointers.
f holds our monadic function and F the dyadic counterparts.
the first function (index 0) is a placeholder. it is never called.
U is the storage space for variables. it holds 26 slots, one for each lower case letter.
but we cannot make use of them, because there is no assignment.</span></span>
<span class="s">f(v,(strchr(V,x)?:V)-V)<span class="e" id="v">
v(x) is used by the parser for both: check if the x is a verb (a primitive function)
and convert the character x to a function value.
here we see why the function pointers start with a dummy value: a result of 0
is not a function.
the special case of the ternary expression a?:b is a shortcut for a?a:b
strchr returns a pointer to the character, not an index, so the start pointer V is
substracted to return the index. strchr returns 0 if x is not within V, so does the v.</span></span>
<span class="s">f(n,10>x-48?x-48:U[x-97])<span class="e" id="n">
n(x) parses nouns, both single character numbers and lower case variable names.
the function converts the character values to numbers by substracting 48 (the ascii value for 0)
or it substracts 97(a) if the value is not within '0' to '9'.
note the special check 10>x-48. this works for unsigned comparison,
because negative numbers are large when converting to unsigned and it's shorter then the
equivalent (x>=48)&&x<48+10.
</span></span>
<span class="s">us(e,u i=*s++;v(i)?x(e(s),Q(x)f[v(i)](x)):x(n(i),*s?y(e(s+1),Q(y)F[v(*s)](x,y)):x))<span class="e" id="e">
e(x) is the core of the interpreter. e may be short for expression, execute or evaluate.
it parses an expression and exectues it directly, like apl.
usually k parses into a parse tree or byte code and execute in a separate step.
e takes an input string, tokenizes the first character and calls itself recursively.
it implements only the minimal monadic/dyadic infix syntax. no parens, adverbs, function, etc.
<span class="l">v</span>(i) tests if the current character is a verb, if yes
it recursively parses the rest of the input. this is k/apl's left of right execution
parsing left-to-right not backwards as many feel apl is doing.
if the current character is not a verb, it is parsed as a noun <span class="l">n</span>(i)
which is returned at the end of the input, or executed dyadically calling F[..] from the function <span class="l">table</span>.
the dyadic case implies that a verb always follows a noun. two nouns in a row is not handled,
which usually implies dyadic @ sometimes called juxtaposition.</span></span>
<span class="s">int main(){char s[99];while(1)if(w(32),s[read(0,s,99)-1]=0,*s)w_(e(s));}<span class="e">
main is the program's entry point. it defines s, a local buffer for the input characters
and goes directly into the read-eval-print-loop.
within the loop it prints k's cursor, a single space (ascii 32), reads a line, terminates the input with a 0
and <span class="l">w_</span> writes the output of the evaluated expression <span class="l">e</span>.</span></span>
</pre><pre><span style="border-bottom:1px solid">a.h</span>
<span class="s">typedef unsigned char c;typedef unsigned long u;u Q=96;<span class="e" id="u">

<span class="s">#define i(n,e) {int $n=n;int i=0;for(;i<$n;++i){e;}}<span class="e" id="i">
i(n,e) is the loop construct. loops are omnipresent in array languages
but they are hidden in the implementation.

<span class="s">#define _(e) ({e;})<span class="e">
_ puts e into a block/scope.</span></span>
<span class="s">#define _u(f,e,x...) u f(x){return({e;});}<span class="e">
_u is the prototypes for other macros which defines a function that returns type <span class="l">u</span> an unsigned integer.
the arguments are defined as the variadic macro x...
e.g. <span class="l">f</span> uses it to define monadic functions and <span class="l">F</span> for dyadic functions.</span></span>
<span class="s">#define nx sx[-1]<span class="e" id="nx">
nx returns the length of a vector. it's not a function but uses x explicitly.
the length is stored in the byte before the data section that x points to.
