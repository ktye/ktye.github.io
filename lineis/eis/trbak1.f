      subroutine trbak1(nm,n,a,e,m,z)
c
      integer i,j,k,l,m,n,nm
      double precision a(nm,n),e(n),z(nm,m)
      double precision s
c
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure trbak1,
c     num. math. 11, 181-195(1968) by martin, reinsch, and wilkinson.
c     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 212-226(1971).
c
c     this subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a real symmetric
c     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
c     symmetric tridiagonal matrix determined by  tred1.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
c          array parameters as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix.
c
c        a contains information about the orthogonal trans-
c          formations used in the reduction by  tred1
c          in its strict lower triangle.
c
c        e contains the subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
c          matrix in its last n-1 positions.  e(1) is arbitrary.
c
c        m is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
c
c        z contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed
c          in its first m columns.
c
c     on output
c
c        z contains the transformed eigenvectors
c          in its first m columns.
c
c     note that trbak1 preserves vector euclidean norms.
