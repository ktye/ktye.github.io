      subroutine ortran(nm,n,low,igh,a,ort,z)
c

c
c     this subroutine is a translation of the algol procedure ortrans,
c     num. math. 16, 181-204(1970) by peters and wilkinson.

c
c     this subroutine accumulates the orthogonal similarity
c     transformations used in the reduction of a real general
c     matrix to upper hessenberg form by  orthes.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
c          array parameters as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix.
c
c        low and igh are integers determined by the balancing
c          subroutine  balanc.  if  balanc  has not been used,
c          set low=1, igh=n.
c
c        a contains information about the orthogonal trans-
c          formations used in the reduction by  orthes
c          in its strict lower triangle.
c
c        ort contains further information about the trans-
c          formations used in the reduction by  orthes.
c          only elements low through igh are used.
c
c     on output
c
c        z contains the transformation matrix produced in the
c          reduction by  orthes.
c
c        ort has been altered.
