      subroutine htrib3(nm,n,a,tau,m,zr,zi)
c
      integer i,j,k,l,m,n,nm
      double precision a(nm,n),tau(2,n),zr(nm,m),zi(nm,m)
      double precision h,s,si
c
c     this subroutine is a translation of a complex analogue of
c     the algol procedure trbak3, num. math. 11, 181-195(1968)

c     handbook for auto. comp., vol.ii-linear algebra, 212-226(1971).
c
c     this subroutine forms the eigenvectors of a complex hermitian
c     matrix by back transforming those of the corresponding
c     real symmetric tridiagonal matrix determined by  htrid3.
c
c     on input
c
c        nm must be set to the row dimension of two-dimensional
c          array parameters as declared in the calling program
c          dimension statement.
c
c        n is the order of the matrix.
c
c        a contains information about the unitary transformations
c          used in the reduction by  htrid3.
c
c        tau contains further information about the transformations.
c
c        m is the number of eigenvectors to be back transformed.
c
c        zr contains the eigenvectors to be back transformed
c          in its first m columns.
c
c     on output
c
c        zr and zi contain the real and imaginary parts,
c          respectively, of the transformed eigenvectors
c          in their first m columns.
c
c     note that the last component of each returned vector
c     is real and that vector euclidean norms are preserved.
