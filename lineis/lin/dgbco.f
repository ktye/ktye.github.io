      subroutine dgbco(abd,lda,n,ml,mu,ipvt,rcond,z)
      integer lda,n,ml,mu,ipvt(1)
      double precision abd(lda,1),z(1)
      double precision rcond
c
c     dgbco factors a double precision band matrix by gaussian
c     elimination and estimates the condition of the matrix.
c
c     if  rcond  is not needed, dgbfa is slightly faster.
c     to solve  a*x = b , follow dgbco by dgbsl.
c     to compute  inverse(a)*c , follow dgbco by dgbsl.
c     to compute  determinant(a) , follow dgbco by dgbdi.

c        abd     double precision(lda, n)
c                contains the matrix in band storage.  the columns
c                of the matrix are stored in the columns of  abd  and
c                the diagonals of the matrix are stored in rows
c                ml+1 through 2*ml+mu+1 of  abd .
c                see the comments below for details.
c
c        lda     integer
c                the leading dimension of the array  abd .
c                lda must be .ge. 2*ml + mu + 1 .
c
c        n       integer
c                the order of the original matrix.
c
c        ml      integer
c                number of diagonals below the main diagonal.
c                0 .le. ml .lt. n .
c
c        mu      integer
c                number of diagonals above the main diagonal.
c                0 .le. mu .lt. n .
c                more efficient if  ml .le. mu .
c
c     on return
c
c        abd     an upper triangular matrix in band storage and
c                the multipliers which were used to obtain it.
c                the factorization can be written  a = l*u  where
c                l  is a product of permutation and unit lower
c                triangular matrices and  u  is upper triangular.
c
c        ipvt    integer(n)
c                an integer vector of pivot indices.
c
c        rcond   double precision
c                an estimate of the reciprocal condition of  a .
c                for the system  a*x = b , relative perturbations
c                in  a  and  b  of size  epsilon  may cause
c                relative perturbations in  x  of size  epsilon/rcond .
c                if  rcond  is so small that the logical expression
c                           1.0 + rcond .eq. 1.0
c                is true, then  a  may be singular to working
c                precision.  in particular,  rcond  is zero  if
c                exact singularity is detected or the estimate
c                underflows.
c
c        z       double precision(n)
c                a work vector whose contents are usually unimportant.
c                if  a  is close to a singular matrix, then  z  is
c                an approximate null vector in the sense that
c                norm(a*z) = rcond*norm(a)*norm(z) .

c     band storage
c
c           if  a  is a band matrix, the following program segment
c           will set up the input.

c                   mu = (band width above the diagonal)
c                   m = ml + mu + 1
c                   do 20 j = 1, n
c                      i1 = max0(1, j-mu)
c                      i2 = min0(n, j+ml)
c                      do 10 i = i1, i2
c                         k = i - j + m
c                         abd(k,j) = a(i,j)
c                10    continue
c                20 continue
c
c           this uses rows  ml+1  through  2*ml+mu+1  of  abd .
c           in addition, the first  ml  rows in  abd  are used for
c           elements generated during the triangularization.
c           the total number of rows needed in  abd  is  2*ml+mu+1 .
c           the  ml+mu by ml+mu  upper left triangle and the
c           ml by ml  lower right triangle are not referenced.
c
c     example..  if the original matrix is
c
c           11 12 13  0  0  0

c      then  n = 6, ml = 1, mu = 2, lda .ge. 5  and abd should contain
