ktye/linux(x86-64)

this is a small linux system in js.
it can execute statically linked elf files.

you can use fasm to assemble executable files.

shell built-ins: ls cp rm mv cat xxd k head
                 wget ed/vi/emacs/nano
redirections:    $a<b>c   no pipe/append/here
no interpolation, no quoting

^C

example:
$wget ../k.wasm  (any files from ktye.github.io)

source:
$wget 86.js sh.js ed.js fs.js index.html
$wget ud/dis.c

execution
elf files are expected to be statically linked
all segments from the program header table are
loaded to virtual memory M.
the first is expected to be executable.
the program counter rip is set to the entry point.

instructions are decoded using udis86 c library
compiled to wasm, see $wget ud/dis.c ud/mk

syscalls are handled by javascript.
execution pauses on read from stdin if no input
file has been redirected, and waits for user input.

debug
$kdb prog arg
